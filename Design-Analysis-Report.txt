Design Criticisms:

1. 
In the provided package, Robot is a concrete class with weak and strong robots defined by a boolean attributes. This 
is a poor design choice because it does not fascilitate polymorphism. We used a Robot constructor which takes a Robot
type parameter in Automail because Automail aggregates and closely uses instances of Robot.

2. MailGenerator contains a pointer to MailPool, which reduces cohesion and increases the representational gap for how
the system should intuitively work. MailGenerator should intuitively do one thing: generate mail. The provided package requires
simulation to call a method in MailGenerator to directly add the mail to MailPool and call the AddToPool method. 
This reduces cohesion because it gives MailGenerator a responsibility it should not. Our solution to this is to de-couple 
MailGenerator and MailPool so that MailGenerator only generates a HashMap of mail. Our system then employs the Simulation class
to provide indirection by generating the time ordered mail set from MailGenerator and adding mail to MailPool Automail.
This system reduces coupling because and allows for greater potnetial extendibility; for instance if we wanted a variable number of
MailGenerators and MailPools we could do so.
